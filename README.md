# Chain Reaction (Tentative Title)

===

#### Abstract

This is an unfinished game project done while I was doing conscription. Contains a ship and an untouchable asteroid floating in a random position in space. There is nothing else to do, other than flying the ship around in space.

===

#### Description

The old vision I had was to create a spaceship game that shoots pellets at asteroids (equilateral  N-gon shapes). Once the asteroids were hit by the pellets, they break up into smaller asteroids, which can be hit by the pellets again to further break up into even smaller asteroids until they disappear. This is very similar to the Asteroids by Atari back in 1979. 

So, what can I do to make it different? I decided on just adding a mouse cursor to Asteroids, and not removing anything else. And voila! But, what makes it special about it? This is where the title "Chain Reaction" comes into play.

The new vision I now have, but never materialized, is to use the mouse to drag the asteroid and fling it across the play field. When it hits another asteroid, the collided asteroids will then break up into smaller-sized asteroids. Same rules apply again if they keep on colliding, until they disappear. What about the ship? That is your target. You must fling the asteroids towards the ship, until the ship hits one of the asteroids and explodes.

The caveat here is that the ship is controlled by A.I. (again, never materialized or started working on) that zips around in space pretty fast. With 90 degrees banking turns, quick acceleration/deceleration, and high top speeds, it's one of the most advanced spaceships a player will get to see. The tables have turned, so the player(s) must do something to stop it.

Isn't it special?
